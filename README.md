The goal of this project is to apply exploratory data analysis, or EDA, to a dataset in order to find trends, discover abnormalities, establish connections, and obtain new insights. EDA is a crucial phase in the data science process that aids in comprehending the information, getting it ready for modeling, and helping to make 
data/: Contains the raw dataset and any intermediate processed data files.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with the EDA process, including data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.
results/: Contains output files, such as visualizations, summaries, or reports generated during EDA.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.
Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess the data.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to explore data distributions and relationships.
Statistical Analysis: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) to understand data characteristics.
Feature Engineering: Identify and create new features if necessary for further analysis or modeling.
Insights and Findings: Document the key insights and findings from the analysis.
Tools and Libraries
Python (version X.X)
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, etc.
How to Run
Clone the repository: git clone [repository URL]
Navigate to the project directory: cd [project folder]
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebooks or scripts to perform the analysis.
